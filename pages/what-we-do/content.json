      "copy": "As previous childcare business owners, we understand exactly why social media is important to your business, and have the knowledge of early years education to support you in media marketing. We also know as a mum what parents want to see from their nursery, and how feeling connected to you helps them trust you and build your reputation.\n\nSometimes managing your social media spaces can feel like a full time job in itself. How do you keep content interesting and relevant? How do you optimise your reach? And how can you build your reputation and grow as a business?\n\nAt the Mulberry Tree we can show you how professional management of your social media channels can have a positive effect on your business.  We will share posts that your audience will want to engage with, comment on and share. There are lots of reasons why using social media is important."

      "copy": "We know that as part of the EYFS, a child’s learning is optimized when there are strong partnerships with home.  Although nurseries often share diaries, sometimes parents just don’t engage. With the majority of people using social media it is an easy way to connect and share with them about their child’s day."

      "title": "Reputation",
      "copy": "An effective social media strategy can give you a place in the community. As a nursery, what do you want to be known for, and how do you achieve that? We plan posts that reinforce ideas about who you are and what your setting offers."

      "title": "Grow your business",
      "copy": "Are you looking to grow your numbers, or even open another setting? Being ‘social’ on social media can drive more traffic to your page and website, increasing your take up. You want a parent to be certain before they even step through the door that they want their child to attend your setting."
